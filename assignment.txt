ASSSIGNMENT-3

1.In an organization number of departments exist. Each department has a name & unique code. Number of employees work in each department. Each employee has unique employee code. Detailed information like name, address, city, basic, date of join are also stored. In a leave register for each employee leave records are kept showing leave type (CL/EL/ML etc.),from date , to-date. When an employee retires or resigns then all the leave information pertaining to him are also deleted. Basic salary must be within Rs.5000 to Rs.9000. A department can not be deleted if any employee record refers to it. Valid grades are A/B/C. Employee name must be in uppercase only. Default value for joining date is system date. Design & implement the tables with necessary constraints to support the scenario depicted above.

2.Try to violate the constraints that you have implemented in the table & note , what happens. [Try with suitable INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE instruction]

3. a) create a view showing employee code, Name,dcode & Basic for a particular department.
b)Try to ensure a row into the view with valid department & also with invalid ones.
c)Find the newly inserted row in the table From which view was created.
d) Try to increment basic by Rs.100/- 
e) Check it in the original table.
f) Delete the view.
4. a)create a view Showing empcode, Name, Deptname Basic, leave type, From date & to date.
b)Try to insert a row in the view check what happens?
c) Try to increment basic by Rs.100.
d) Delete the view.

5. a)Create a table having empcode , Name, Deptname, & basic From the existing tables alongwith the records of the employee who are in a particular department(say, d1) and with a basic Rs 7000/- 
b) From the existing table add the employees with the basic salary greater than or equal to 7000/ -
c) Alter the table to add a net pay column.
d) Replace net pay with 1.5* Basic.
e) Try to remove the net net pay column.
[ It may require no. of steps]

6. Drop all the tables that you have created.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ASSIGNMENT - 4

1) Accept an employee code from user . Find the name of the employee from EMP table. If the employee is not existing then indicate it through a suitable message.

2) Write a PL / SQL block to add row in EMP table . If employee code is duplicate/dept code is not present in DEPT tabl e then message is to be shown & row can not be added.

3) From the EMP table find the name of top 5 (according to basic salary) employees

.
4) Accept a department code from the user . Delete all the employee rows with that department code. Show how many rows h ave been deleted.

5).Consider the following tables:
Table: ORDERMAST
Structure:
ORDER_NO CHAR(5) primary key
ORDER_DT DATE
Table: ORDERDETAILS
Structure:
ORDER_NO CHAR(5)
ITEM_NO CHAR(5)
QTY NUMBER
ORDER_NO + ITEM_NO is primary key
Table: DELIVERYMAST
Structure:
DELV_NO CHAR(5) primary key
ORDER_NO CHAR(5)
DELV_DT DATE
Table: DELIVERY_DETAILS
Structure:
DELV_NO CHAR(5)
ITEM_NO CHAR(5)
QTY NUMBER DELV_NO+ITEM_NO is primary key

Write a PL/SQL block which accepts two dates & find the information of the pending delivery for the orders placed between t he two dates supplied by the user. Note, an order can have request for multiple items. Against an order, multiple delivery with partial shipment is possible.

6) Assume a LEAVE table with emp_no,month,no._of_days. For each employee find the effective basic for the current month as per the formula given below: BASIC - (BASIC * no. of leave days in the month)/no. of days in that month
